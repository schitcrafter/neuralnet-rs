# Neural networks implementation in Rust

This is just a project for me to learn more about neural networks and their implementation. Made in Rust because I like the language.

## Data

Training data here is from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. I haven't added it to the repository because I'm not sure about their copyright, plus only the images are ~10MB compressed.

## TODO

 - [ ] velocity
 - [ ] change learning rate based on some algorithm (exponential, time-step, etc)
 - [ ] other activation functions
 - [ ] different actiation functions for each layer / for output and inner layers
